	<h1>Paid Dues</h1>
	<p>I've worked hard over my short lifetime. I've spent over seven years working as hard as I can to be a cook. Before that (and coinciding with that)
		it was working at a snow removal company starting at 13 or 14 years old. I've done rofessional commission work as a jeweler, graphic designer,
		and miniature painter. My body is in relatively constant pain and I'm almost certain I'll have to have my right knee replaced at least once.
		Don't misunderstand these examples. I'm no saint and I don't think of myself as a good person. I'm just me and who I want to be, which
		in this case is kind of a dick who likes to have some fun every once in a while and get things done. Its taken me most of my life to start thinking forward
		and to create a way all my own influenced by pieces of people that come into my life. If methodology was a tapestry then mine would be covered in stitches.
		I want to create things unknown to most and have them be shocked by it and laugh. Who knows maybe I'll publish a book on my thoughts next if someone actually finds my words helpful
		and maybe stop writing philosophical conjecture late as hell at night. Or early as hell in the morning depending on when you wake up/ go to bed.</p>
