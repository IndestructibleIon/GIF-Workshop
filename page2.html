	<h1>Some Confusion About This Coding Delusion</h1>
	<p>
	Code is difficult for me to grasp. I enjoy puzzles to an extent but not without the use of my hands in a more physical manner
	or a form of intrigue and social deduction. It could be that I was taught poorly when forst exposed to coding and that could be the
	reason I dislike it, who knows?
