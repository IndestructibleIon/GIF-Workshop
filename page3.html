	<h1>Full Bore</h1>
	<p> What about the work we do as artists that makes us so important to society? Revealing the flaws or imperfections in government and authority?
		Changing the notions on race and gender held by others? Elevating the issues between economic classes to the view of the entire populace?
		Who knows, but I understand that I want people to enjoy my work. I want to create a layer of understanding for all of those people who view my art.
		Without understanding we cannot have patience and progress, and then where are we? Stuck and unable to move.</p>
